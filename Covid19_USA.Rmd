**Introduction**

The project aims to visualize the state-wise COVID-19 data in the United States, focusing on trends, comparisons, and correlations within the data. We will use the ggplot2 package in R for exploring and visualizing the data, which will result into meaningful insights about the pandemic's impact in the country and at the state level.

The data was obtained from the official website of The COVID tracking project: <https://covidtracking.com/data/download>

**Objectives:**

1.  To explore and visualize state-wise trends across the country regarding COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and testing.

2.  To compare the pandemic's impact across different states of the country.

3.  To explore the correlations between various indicators such as positive cases, testing rates, and hospitalizations.

4.  To identify patterns and outliers in the data.

| `totalTestResults`                 | In most states, the `totalTestResults` field is currently computed by adding positive and negative values because, historically, some states do not report totals, and to work around different reporting cadences for cases and tests.                                                     |
| ~~`totalTestResultsIncrease`~~     | Daily increase in `totalTestResults`, calculated from the previous day's value. This calculation includes all the caveats associated with `totalTestResults`, and **it is recommended against using it at the state/territory level**, so we will not be using it in this project.          |

```{r install_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
packages_to_install <- c("rmarkdown", "renv", "shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "usmap")
#install.packages(packages_to_install)

```

### **Data cleaning and exploratory analysis**

Now we read and print the summary of the data:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE, fig.height=20}
setwd("~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-d.quinterona@student.uw.edu.pl/My Drive/UW/III-Semester/Visualization in R/Final Project/COVID-19_USA")
data <- read.csv("data/all-states-history (1).csv",sep=",")
print(summary(data))
```

It is necessary to categorize the variables properly before moving to the visualization and analysis:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str(data)

```

We need to categorize `date` as a date class and `state` as factor to be able to visualize the data properly in the plots and in the dashboard page. We will also drop the columns `totalTestResultsIncrease` and `positiveScore` as it was recommended not to use it by the creators of the data due to inaccuracies.

```{r dataTransform, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
data$state <- as.factor(data$state)

data <- data %>%
  select(-c("positiveScore", "totalTestResultsIncrease"))
```

After transformation, the data:

```{r}
str(data)
summary(data)
```

Variable `date` is now as in date format, which will allow us to graph the time series in a better way. Also, `states` are now as factor, with 56 levels; which consist of the 50 states, the federal district and 5 major territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the US virgin islands).

Unfortunately, a lot of variables have too many NA values. Some of them even over 50%. So here the first thing is we need to deal with the NA values:

```{r}
na_count_dplyr <- data %>% summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.)))
print(na_count_dplyr)
```

Firstly, we will deal with the missing values of `deathConfirmed` and `deathProbable`. These 2 variables mean the total fatalities. But they have the significant NA values. So we must deal with it carefully. Firstly, we will try to find the patterns of these missing values. We will consider 2 perspectives: States (region) and Time.

State-wise Pattern: We'll summarize the number of missing values for each state.

Time-wise Pattern: We'll summarize the number of missing values over time

### State wise pattern analysis 

Here we create a bar plot with same height, each bar shows the percentage of confirmed and probable missing values. And above the bar, we show the numbers of total missing values.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Calculate the percentage of missing values for each state
state_missing_percentage <- data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(
    Total = n(),  # Total count for each state
    Confirmed_Missing = sum(is.na(deathConfirmed)),
    Probable_Missing = sum(is.na(deathProbable)),
    Total_Missing = Confirmed_Missing + Probable_Missing
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    Confirmed_Percentage = Confirmed_Missing / Total_Missing * 100,
    Probable_Percentage = Probable_Missing / Total_Missing * 100
  )
```

We configured the plot in a way that the boundaries are colored in to grey, to be able to see them better. And it was necessary to make the canvas bigger to see everything clear:

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
ggplot(state_missing_percentage, aes(x = state, y = 100)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = "Confirmed Percentage"), stat = "identity", width = 0.8, color = "grey") +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Probable_Percentage, fill = "Probable Percentage"), stat = "identity", width = 0.8, color = "grey") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Confirmed Percentage" = "blue", "Probable Percentage" = "orange")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Missing Data Types by State",
       x = "State",
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Data Type")
```

There are 2 states very strange, may have special reasons. Because almost all of their missing values are confirmed percentage. Probably, they have limited hospitals or economic state. We decide to remove all of the records of these 2 states to analyze. Then probably do special analysis for both of them later. They are NJ and ME

```{r}
# Removing records for NJ and ME
data_filtered <- data %>%
  filter(state != "NJ", state != "ME")
```

Now do the time wise pattern

```{r}
# Group by Year-Month and summarize the number of missing values
time_pattern <- data %>%
  mutate(YearMonth = format(date, "%Y-%m")) %>%
  group_by(YearMonth) %>%
  summarise(
    Missing_deathConfirmed = sum(is.na(deathConfirmed)),
    Missing_deathProbable = sum(is.na(deathProbable))
  )

# Plotting the time-wise missing data pattern
ggplot(time_pattern, aes(x = YearMonth)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Missing_deathConfirmed, group = 1, colour = "deathConfirmed")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Missing_deathProbable, group = 1, colour = "deathProbable")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Time-wise Missing Data for deathConfirmed and deathProbable",
       x = "Year-Month",
       y = "Number of Missing Values",
       colour = "Variable")
```

### Visualizing the data

*All the plots presented below are in the second page called Dashboard. You can go directly there and play with the graphs as it was built in as an interactive shiny dashboard. For details about the construction of the plots and code chunks, please keep reading below.*

[Here would be nice to plot the USA map by states and show with colors variables like confirmed deaths, positive cases, total tests done, etc. So far I was trying to map this but didnt manage :( Maybe you can try with your dear friend GPT 4.0?]{.underline}

[Some statistics about which state had the most cases, deaths, people in ICU, recovered]{.underline}

[Then we can plot histograms for the variables, maybe by state? there are 56 states data, maybe 7x8 grid with histograms or box plots??]{.underline}

And then we can use the paper you sent me and plot nicely other variables :)

If we have sometime we can build a dashboard to get more points, if not, we can forget about the part below :)

# Dashboard {data-icon="fa-signal"}

```{r global, include=FALSE}
d <- data_transformed
```

### USA Plot

## Sidebar {.sidebar}

Here we can put to select states (if we want to visualize data for only one state or many) and also which variable to visualize.

```{r}
selectInput(
  "n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
  choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20
)

sliderInput(
  "bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
  min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2
)
```

## Plot/Plots

the code is from an example I saw on internet :) just as a reference

```{r}
renderPlot({
  erpt = faithful$eruptions
  hist(
    erpt, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.integer(input$n_breaks),
    xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser Eruption Duration",
    col = 'gray', border = 'white'
  )
  
  dens = density(erpt, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
})
```

```{r}


```
